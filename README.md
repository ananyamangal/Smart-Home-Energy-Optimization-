# SYNERGY: Smart Home Energy Optimization System

SYNERGY is a data-driven smart home energy optimization system that leverages real-time IoT sensing, machine learning, and intelligent recommendations to reduce energy waste and promote sustainable living.

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**  
  Uses a network of IoT sensors to track energy usage, occupancy, and environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.).

- **Predictive Analytics**
  - **Energy Forecasting**: Predicts future energy usage of individual appliances.
  - **Peak Load Detection**: Identifies high-consumption periods and suggests load balancing strategies.
  - **Anomaly Detection**: Detects unusual energy behavior (e.g., unused devices consuming power).

- **AI-Powered Recommendations**  
  Provides intelligent, context-aware suggestions for reducing energy consumption, powered by integration with large language models.

- **Interactive Dashboard**  
  Real-time web interface (built with Next.js) that visualizes energy data and system insights.

| **ML Backend**       | Scikit-learn, XGBoost   | Forecasting, anomaly detection, optimization models, NLP based recommendation module           |
| **API Layer**        | FastAPI (RESTful)       | Connects backend, ML models, and frontend for seamless data flow.  |
| **Frontend**         | Next.js                 | Real-time visualizations and user interactions.                    |

- **Data Collection**  
  IoT sensors feed continuous data into a central MySQL database.

- **Machine Learning Backend**  
  Models built using Scikit-learn and XGBoost (serialized with Joblib) handle forecasting, anomaly detection, and optimization.

- **API Layer**  
  RESTful APIs connect the backend, ML models, and frontend for seamless data flow.

- **Frontend**  
  Built with Next.js to display real-time visualizations and user interactions.

- Multi-language support for accessibility.
- Integration with Alexa, Google Home, and other smart assistants.

## üöÄ Deployment

- **Backend**: Developed using **FastAPI**, hosted on **Render**.
- **Database**: **MySQL** database provisioned on **Railway**.
- **Frontend**: Built with **Next.js**, deployed on **Vercel**.
- The backend connects securely to the cloud database using environment variables.
- The frontend communicates with the backend via a public API URL.

## üõ†Ô∏è Running Locally

Follow the steps below to set up the project on your local machine.

### 1. Set Up the MySQL Database
- Install MySQL.
- Create a new database (e.g., `SmartHomeEnergyUsageDB`).
- Import the provided `.sql` file to create tables and insert sample data.

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd fastapi-backend
Create a .env file in the backend directory with your database credentials:
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=SmartHomeEnergyUsageDB
```  
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```  
### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
